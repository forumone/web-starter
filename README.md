# Web Starter Kit

This project has been setup to use a virtual machine for local development to closely mirror the production environment. To use the the virtual machine, follow these instructions.

## Preparing your local environment

  * Latest Virtualbox -- [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). If you are running Win 7 install 4.2.x
  * Latest Virtualbox Extension Pack -- [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]. Should match your Virtualbox version
  * Vagrant (currently tested with 1.3.5 and 1.6.2) -- [http://downloads.vagrantup.com](http://downloads.vagrantup.com)


## Getting Vagrant environment set up
Starting from within the root of your project (an existing project which already has a vagrant/puppet configured or starting a new project from the Drupal Starter Project), do the following:

1. Create VM by running "vagrant up" (This step will take long (might be 5+ minutes) as all necessary components are being downloaded and installed)
  * If you get an error re-provision the VM by running "vagrant provision" to see if this resolves the issue
2. SSH into VM by running "vagrant ssh"
3. Navigate to VM docroot by running "cd /vagrant/public"
4. Install Drupal using custom install profile by running "drush si [profile] -y" and following prompts. Alterntatively, use drush aliases to synch to a development instance of a site database. 

## Troubleshooting

Occasionally some issues may occur that prevent you from loading the virtual machine. Below are some common issues that others have experienced.

### General

If the virtual machine does not boot up and you get a message saying there was a timeout, try launching the VM through the Virtualbox interface to get more detailed information.


### Macintosh machines

* If you experience errors when sharing the folder over NFS you may need to enable File Sharing in System Preferences -> Sharing
* If you receive an error about an invalid export you may need to manually delete /etc/exports file
* If you've updated to Mavericks and Virtualbox is no longer working, try the following command: sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart
* If you are prompted to enter your password when SSHing from the VM ensure your SSH private key is in the keychain by running "ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa" from your machine

### Linux machines

* If you experience errors when sharing the folder over NFS you may need to install the appropriate NFS packages, on Ubuntu you will need to run "sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server"

### Windows machines

* Virtualbox requires the Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) be enabled, if you receive a message saying that the VM requires a 64 bit processor and you only have an i686 processor this may be the cause
* Virtualbox may trigger a Windows Firewall popup to allow ports to be shared
* If the provisioning fails with errors on ports.conf or sites.xml this may be due to CRLF issues with the configuration files, to resolve this take the following actions:
  1. git config --global --edit
  2. Add line if missing: [core]
  3. Below that line add line: autocrlf = input
* if your ssh key information does not correctly forward, you can copy your ssh private key to ~/.ssh and chmod it 700
* if git says everything is changed, it's probably the line endings issues you've most likely seen before, doing "git add -u" should just remove them from the list (and not add them to be committed)


## Drush Alias File

An example alias file to connect with a Drupal site running in Virtualbox:

```
$aliases['local'] = array(
  'parent' => '@parent',
  'uri' => 'http://10.11.12.14',
  'root' => '/vagrant/public',
  'remote-host' => '10.11.12.14',
  'remote-user' => 'vagrant',
  'ssh-options' => "-i ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -l vagrant",
  'db-url' => 'mysql://web:web@10.11.12.14:3306/web',
  'databases' => array (
    'default' => array (
      'default' => array (
        'database' => 'web',
        'username' => 'web',
        'password' => 'web',
        'host' => '10.11.12.14',
        'port' => '',
        'driver' => 'mysql',
        'prefix' => '',
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Database sync

You can have your drupal site database automatically updated on 'vagrant provision'. 

* copy examples/config/s3fg to the root of the repository and rename to .s3cfg
* modify the password in .s3cfg
* copy puppet/shell/custom/example-drupal-post-provision.unprivileged.sh to puppet/shell/custom/post-provision.unprivileged.sh
* edit puppet/shell/custom/post-provision.unprivileged.sh and fill your project name into the variable at the top.
* upload an encrypted .tgz of your database dump to s3://f1dev/PROJECTNAME.dev.sql.gz . You might find it easiest with this cron task:
```
0 0 * * * export HOME=/var/www/vhosts/PROJECTNAME.dev; /bin/gzip -c $HOME/current/db.sql > $HOME/PROJECTNAME.dev.sql.gz && /usr/bin/s3cmd put $HOME/PROJECTNAME.dev.sql.gz s3://f1dev
```
Note that dev will have to have a matching ~/.s3cfg file for this to work!
